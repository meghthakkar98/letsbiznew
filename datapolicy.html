                </strong>
                We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Letsbiz ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.

                </strong>
                We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in your Letsbiz Settings.<br/>
                <br/>
                We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Letsbiz Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you search for something on Letsbiz, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID OR ANY Other documentations for account verification purposes, we keep the copy with us until needed.<br/>

If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead.
