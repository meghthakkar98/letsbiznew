                <li class="list-item-57">P2P is not intended to be used for business, commercial, or merchant transactions and such use may be discontinued without notice by us at any time. We may reverse or place a hold on your transactions or place funds in reserve if evidence of business, commercial, or merchant use is discovered.</li>
                <li class="list-item-58">If you receive and accept a P2P transfer you are liable to us for not only the payment but also any third-party fees that may result from a later invalidation of that payment for any reason, including without limitation if you lose a claim or a chargeback, or if the payment is reversed. We reserve the right to charge your payment credential or take any other legal action to collect the funds to the full extent allowed by applicable law.</li>
                <li class="list-item-59">Use of P2P may subject you to fees including without limitation those from third parties, such as reversal charges or other fees for insufficient funds if your attempted payment is rejected.</li>
                <li class="list-item-60">P2P must be used in compliance with applicable law and may not be used in connection with any illegal or illicit transaction. In addition, payments relating to the following activities are prohibited regardless of whether the activity is illegal in your location: (a) weapons, ammunitions, or explosives; and (b) gambling, games of skill, lotteries, raffles, or fantasy sports. If illegal, illicit, or otherwise prohibited transactions are reported or discovered, we reserve the right to take action including without limitation the following, without notice to you: place a hold on your transactions; place your funds in reserve; limit your ability to use payments features through the Letsbiz Products; report the activity to authorities; or deactivate your account entirely.</li>
                <li class="list-item-61">P2P use is at your sole risk and we assume no responsibility for the underlying transaction of funds, or the actions or identity of any transfer recipient or sender. Disputes regarding funds are between you and the sender of a payment. If a sender files a claim for a chargeback after a P2P transaction, we are not responsible for determining the veracity of claims or the disposition of the payment.</li>
                <li class="list-item-62">Minnesota residents: To opt out of P2P, please send written notice of your choice to: B/704 Samarpan Tower, 132ft ring road, Naranpura, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, Pin code - 380013.

When you fund a transaction, you authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the full amount to the payment credential you designate for the transaction. You also authorize us to collect and store that payment credential, along with other related transaction information. We may also use certain payment card updater services, whose availability varies by issuer, to ensure we have the most up-to-date information about payment credential we store.

Your card will be charged at the time you initiate a payment, or shortly thereafter. If you cancel a transaction before completion, this pre-approval may result in those funds not otherwise being immediately available to you.
